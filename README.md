# Infernum

A Rust-based LLM inference server designed to be researcher-friendly, type-safe, and composable.

## Goals

- **Researcher-friendly**: Easy integration of new inference ideas with fast benchmarking
- **AI-assistant friendly**: Clean, readable codebase with consistent patterns
- **Type-safe**: Rust's type system enforces correctness at compile time
- **Composable**: Building blocks that can be mixed and matched

## Status

Early development. See `docs/initial-plan.md` for the full design document and roadmap.

## Building

```bash
cargo build
cargo test --all
```
